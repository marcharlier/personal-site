## I’m an experienced product management & design leader with a passion for prototyping, innovation and creating great products.

My skills span multiple areas of design, leadership as well as software product management. 

I have a particular interest in the intersection of digital and physical touch points. My approach combines analytical and creative methods.

### Unmade

I’m currently Head of Product & Design at [Unmade](https://www.unmade.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I lead a team of four product managers and two product designers.

We are an enterprise SaaS product for custom on-demand apparel production. Our customers are teamwear businesses and clothing brands.

### Previous roles

Previously I have worked as a designer in consultancies like Frog Design, FJORD (now Accenture Song) and Method. I have also worked as an independent freelance consultant working with startups. I’ve also worked at art collective Random International. Head to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martincharlier/){:target="_blank"} to see my full cv. 

I’ve worked on strategic projects across design & innovation for companies like Sky, The Automobile Association, Nokia, Vertu, The Goodwood Estate and Tesco.

### Other projects

I sometimes work on things that are not strictly my “day job”. This work often falls within the themes I am interested in. Here are some examples:

*Industrial & interaction design for tech products*

I have contributed chapters about this to the [O’Reilly book “Designing Connected Products”](http://www.designingconnectedproducts.com/){:target="_blank"}. My chapters are about Interaction-, Service- and Industrial Design.

Together with my friends Tom and Dev, we have explored [ambient connected devices](https://raincloud.eu/){:target="_blank"} through a project making a weather device called “Rain Cloud”. Using funding from InnovateUK and Creative England, we developed and prototyped a connected device with the benefits of IoT connectivity, but without the burden of a complex screen-based UI.

*Experience prototyping*

Rapid experience prototyping for connected devices and services tend to be hard to share outside of workshop situations.
Tom Metcalfe and I have developed a technique that combines low-fidelity with the share-ability of video.

A good overview is my [presentation at O'Reilly Design 2017](https://www.slideshare.net/MartinCharlier/video-as-a-prototyping-tool-for-connected-products-88595992){:target="_blank"}.
