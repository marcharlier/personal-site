			<h2>I’m an experienced product management &amp; design leader with a passion for prototyping, innovation and creating great products.</h2>
<p>My skills span multiple areas of design, leadership as well as software product management. </p>
<p>I have a particular interest in the intersection of digital and physical touch points. My approach combines analytical and creative methods.</p>
<h3>Unmade</h3>
<p>I’m currently Head of Product &amp; Design at <a href="https://www.unmade.com/" target="_blank">Unmade</a>, where I lead a team of four product managers and two product designers.</p>
<p>We are an enterprise SaaS product for custom on-demand apparel production. Our customers are teamwear businesses and clothing brands.</p>
<h3>Previous roles</h3>
<p>Previously I have worked as a designer in consultancies like Frog Design, FJORD (now Accenture Song) and Method. I have also worked as an independent freelance consultant working with startups. I’ve also worked at art collective Random International. Head to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martincharlier/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> to see my full cv. </p>
<p>I’ve worked on strategic projects across design &amp; innovation for companies like Sky, The Automobile Association, Nokia, Vertu, The Goodwood Estate and Tesco.</p>
<h3>Other projects</h3>
<p>I sometimes work on things that are not strictly my “day job”. This work often falls within the themes I am interested in. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>Industrial &amp; interaction design for tech products</em></p>
<p>I have contributed chapters about this to the <a href="http://www.designingconnectedproducts.com/" target="_blank">O’Reilly book “Designing Connected Products”</a>. My chapters are about Interaction-, Service- and Industrial Design.</p>
<p>Together with my friends Tom and Dev, we have explored <a href="https://raincloud.eu/" target="_blank">ambient connected devices</a> through a project making a weather device called “Rain Cloud”. Using funding from InnovateUK and Creative England, we developed and prototyped a connected device with the benefits of IoT connectivity, but without the burden of a complex screen-based UI.</p>
<p><em>Experience prototyping</em></p>
<p>Rapid experience prototyping for connected devices and services tend to be hard to share outside of workshop situations.
Tom Metcalfe and I have developed a technique that combines low-fidelity with the share-ability of video.</p>
<p>A good overview is my <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/MartinCharlier/video-as-a-prototyping-tool-for-connected-products-88595992" target="_blank">presentation at O'Reilly Design 2017</a>. </p>
